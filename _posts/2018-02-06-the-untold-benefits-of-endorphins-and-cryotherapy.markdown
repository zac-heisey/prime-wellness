Among its many benefits, [cryotherapy](/cryotherapy) can help release endorphins that provide their own list of mind and body enhancements. Below we'll discuss some specifics about endorphins, how they affect our bodies, and how cryotherapy plays a role in releasing beneficial endorphins to improve mindfulness and physical performance.

## What are Endorphins?

Endorphin is a combination of the words “endogenous” which means originating inside the body, and morphine, an opioid pain medication. Endorphins are known to be chemicals to in the brain to transmit electrical signals in the nervous system and help to relieve pain and induce feelings of pleasure or euphoria. Narcotic pain medications including morphine and codeine mimic the job of natural endorphins. Research has shown those who experience chronic pain conditions have low levels of endorphins than normal.

## What Causes the Release of Endorphins?

Stress and pain are the two most common factors leading to the release of endorphins. The pituitary gland releases them during periods of strenuous exercise, emotional stress, pain, and orgasm. This secretion leads to euphoric feelings, modification of appetite, the release of sex hormones, and enhanced immune response. Those with low endorphin levels are often stressed, depressed, exhausted, fatigued, etc. Increased endorphins in the body also ease stress, prevents insomnia, relief from muscle pain and joint pain, relief from itching and more.

## How Does Cryotherapy Help the Release of Endorphins?

Whole Body Cryotherapy is a cold healing procedure and has been proven to have a positive effect on the physical and mental wellbeing because cryotherapy stimulates and increases endorphins in the body. When the body is exposed to extremely cold temperatures, it begins to increase endorphins. Increased circulation from cryotherapy can boost energy and bring oxygen-rich blood to all the cells of the body.
