[Glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) (or GSH) is currently the subject of over 102,000 published studies, and that number is increasing weekly. For professional athletes, sports enthusiasts, and regular exercisers, glutathione supports remarkable energy boosts during strenuous exercise. A current trend driven by this antioxidant, the instant gratification effect of a prompt return to normal energy levels after a workout without combatting fatigue. Still, this powerful antioxidant does much more than just that. It sustains energy empowerment, rejuvenation, and vitality that support healthy heart activity, brain function, and immune system activity. This is what enables the mind and body to endure strenuous athletic action, returning afterward to regular performance levels without stress or difficulty.

Free radicals are produced during normal cellular metabolism and increase when we exercise. These free radicals react within the cells by a process called oxidation and can result in inflammation to accumulate with our bodies. Over time, this inflammation accumulates within the cell and decreases the function of the cell and eventually leads to cellular death unless we have a way of reversing the process. To fight this cellular destruction our body uses an antioxidant, and the “Master Antioxidant” in the body's Glutathione.

Several studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of glutathione in protecting our body’s tissues from free radicals and exercise-induced stress. Increasing Glutathione can increase energy, decrease recovery time, and provide our cells with the tools so that they can function at an optimal level.

### The Benefits of Increasing Glutathione in Athletes:

* Increases Stamina

* Increases Endurance

* Lessens exhaustion

* Lessens muscle fatigue

* Quickens recovery time

* Feeds muscles

* Decreases inflammation

* Increases energy

* Improves cardiovascular function

Up until very recently, there was no efficient way to get glutathione into our bodies other than intravenous (IV), and even that method remains controversial in regards to absorbency. Luckily, thanks to the increasing number of studies, we are finding alternative, safe and natural ways to increase our glutathione levels. The common suggestions for increasing glutathione in the body are: turmeric, vitamin C, meditation, yoga, raw egg and milk, organic vegetables, exercise, limiting rigorous exercise to 1- 2 days a week, whey protein, red meat, and Acetyl Glutathione. Thus, many of the suggested ways can easily be compromised by a variety of factors and can lead no result.  When it comes to superficial glutathione (glutathione not produced by your own cells, such as pill form) it may actually inhibit melanin synthesis!

**The good news:** when validated by research, there’s a couple ways you can increase your glutathione levels that have shown consistent results.

**[Whole Body Cryotherapy](/cryotherapy)**: There’s now clinical proof that WBC (whole-body cryotherapy) enhances the resistance of the human body, also thanks to the beneficial effect on the antioxidant system. Accordingly, this study shows the effects of a series of whole-body cryostimulation on the level of enzymes that activate glutathione in the cells.

**Acetyl Glutathione** is a Glutathione supplement that’s showing a promising absorbency result. Usually, only very small amounts of pre-manufactured glutathione are able to enter the bloodstream. Most of it is lost in the digestive tract and cannot effectively raise intracellular glutathione levels in the most important detoxification organs such as liver, kidneys, and lungs. This is because glutathione is a small protein molecule and gets digested. However, researcher Dr. Rhonda Patrick states, “You can have excess Glutathione sitting in your cells, doing virtually nothing, when there’s absence of the enzymes that use it.” Fortunately, next on the list, is a biohack to naturally activate the enzymes that use it.

**Protandim** is one of the most promising ways to enhance the body’s own production of glutathione. The supplement is comprised of five natural ingredients, and it has been scientifically proven in a published peer-reviewed study to increase the body’s productions of glutathione levels by 300%. There is no other way our body can increase our production of Glutathione naturally at this scale!
