RISE Prime Wellness yoga is the first of its kind. Medically managed by a Doctor of [Physical Therapy](/physical-therapy), RPW yoga classes are small group classes. Unlike other studios, we cap our classes at 10 people. We believe that people move the best in a small guided setting. With small class sizes, our trained yoga instructors have more time to oversee their class attendees for a more safe and functional practice. With functional movement and mobility in mind, our yoga instructors have been trained to update your yoga practice with the understanding of human anatomy and functional needs. You will be introduced to dynamic stretching, functional balance training, and strengthening poses that will help you on and off the mat.

All classes are available to all levels of students. Each class offers a variety of options for each pose and transition so that you can adjust your yoga class to your skill set and needs. For further information about each class style, please see our class description page. We look forward to seeing you on the mat!

    <h3>Ground & Flow</h3>

    <h3>Gentle Restorative</h3>
    <p>This class will begin with gentle mindful movements easing into restorative yoga. Restorative yoga is a restful practice that is all about slowing down, and opening your body through passive stretching. Yoga postures are held longer than conventional yoga as exercise, and will be supported with yoga props such as folded blankets and bolsters. This class will help your mind and body feel relaxed, and will reduce stress.</p>

    <h3>Dani</h3>
    <p>Dani began practicing yoga over a decade ago and was immediately drawn in by the sense of inner peace and connectedness felt through this seemingly physical practice. Dani hopes to empower her students to slow down, and feel every aspect of their practice to ultimately connect with every part of themselves. “I feel in today’s world, the tendency is to always keep pushing through and not necessarily take the time to pause, connect, and FEEL in the present. In this place of presence and connection, healing can truly take place. Yoga was the cure that gave me a sense of peace, ease, hope, grounding and sense of security that I had never felt before and I am humbled to be able to now share this “cure” with others.”</p>

    <h3>Aashna</h3>
    <p>Aashna was introduced to Yoga 20 years ago after a back injury took her off the sports field. Back then, yoga mats ceased to exist and she vividly remembers learning the art of asana and meditation in a small, simple dwelling in Northern India. Across the decades, regardless of country, continent or survival funds, yoga has been Aashna’s physical and mental therapy - showing up for her when she least expected and most often, when times got stressful and she was on the brink of big life decisions. Many moons later, Aashna finally decided to deepen her practice by becoming a certified yoga teacher alongside her corporate career. As a true believer in the power of this sacred, ancient practice, she thrives on supporting individuals from all walks of life with their own journey's, so they too can take baby steps to nourish their souls, one breath at a time.</p>
