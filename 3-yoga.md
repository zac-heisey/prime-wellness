RISE Prime Wellness yoga is the first of its kind. Medically managed by a Doctor of [Physical Therapy](/physical-therapy), RPW yoga classes are small group classes. Unlike other studios, we cap our classes at 10 people. We believe that people move the best in a small guided setting. With small class sizes, our trained yoga instructors have more time to oversee their class attendees for a more safe and functional practice. With functional movement and mobility in mind, our yoga instructors have been trained to update your yoga practice with the understanding of human anatomy and functional needs. You will be introduced to dynamic stretching, functional balance training, and strengthening poses that will help you on and off the mat.

All classes are available to all levels of students. Each class offers a variety of options for each pose and transition so that you can adjust your yoga class to your skill set and needs. For further information about each class style, please see our class description page. We look forward to seeing you on the mat!
